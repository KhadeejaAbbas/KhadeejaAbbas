## Hello 👋 , my name is Khadeeja Abbas

I'm a Canadian 🇨🇦 currently in the Mountain Time Zone 🏔. 

I'm interested in researching the best ways to help as many people I can. This includes using technical skills to solve old problems - such as Tuberculosis 🧬 !
My hobbies include training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu 🥋, running 🏃‍♂️, cloud-gazing ☁️, playing with dev boards 💡, or chilling with my family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.
