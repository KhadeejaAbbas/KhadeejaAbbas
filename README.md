## 🍓 About me

![profile view count](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=KhadeejaAbbas)

I'm a Canadian 🇨🇦 currently in the Mountain Time Zone 🏔. I'm interested in researching the best ways to help as many people I can. This includes using technical skills to solve old problems - such as Tuberculosis 🧬 ! When I'm not chasing purpose, I can be found training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu 🥋, running 🏃‍♂️, swimming 🏊, playing with dev boards 💡, or chilling with my family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦. 
## 🔭 I'm currently working on

Independent research in gene analysis 🧬 for Tuberculosis supervised by Dr. Shuyi Ma 

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
